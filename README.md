# ShieldVultus üõ°Ô∏è

**ShieldVultus** is a cybersecurity application developed for the GIIS IDEATE 3.0 event, AppElevate, as part of a school project. This tool is designed to offer robust protection by scanning files and URLs for potential threats. The project showcases practical skills in security application development and aims to demonstrate effective techniques for threat detection and management.

## Project Overview

ShieldVultus provides three main functionalities:

1. **File Scan**: 
   - **Purpose**: Detect potential security threats in files and directories.
   - **How**: By integrating with VirusTotal‚Äôs API, the application scans selected files or directories for malicious content and provides a safety report.

2. **URL Check**:
   - **Purpose**: Analyze URLs to determine if they are safe and to uncover the final destination of shortened URLs.
   - **How**: Input a URL to receive a safety assessment and resolution of any shortened links to their original form.

3. **Quarantine Management**:
   - **Purpose**: Isolate potentially dangerous files to prevent them from causing harm, and manage these files effectively.
   - **How**: Move files to a quarantine directory, list quarantined items, and restore them if they are verified as safe.

## Features

- **File Scan**: Scan individual files or entire directories for malware using VirusTotal.
- **URL Check**: Evaluate the safety of URLs and resolve shortened URLs to their original destinations.
- **Quarantine Management**: Manage quarantined files by isolating, listing, and restoring them as needed.

## Installation
