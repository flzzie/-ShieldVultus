## Project Overview

ShieldVultus provides three main functionalities:

1. **File Scan**: 
   - **Purpose**: Detect potential security threats in files and directories.
   - **How**: Integrates with VirusTotal‚Äôs API to scan selected files or directories for malicious content and provide a safety report.

2. **URL Check**:
   - **Purpose**: Analyze URLs to determine if they are safe and uncover the final destination of shortened URLs.
   - **How**: Input a URL to receive a safety assessment and resolve any shortened links to their original form.

3. **Quarantine Management**:
   - **Purpose**: Isolate potentially dangerous files to prevent harm and manage these files effectively.
   - **How**: Move files to a quarantine directory, list quarantined items, and restore them if verified as safe.

## Features

- **File Scan**: Scan individual files or entire directories for malware using VirusTotal.
- **URL Check**: Evaluate the safety of URLs and resolve shortened URLs to their original destinations.
- **Quarantine Management**: Manage quarantined files by isolating, listing, and restoring them as needed.
